Weighly is a service to weigh things, it was originally meant for food, but it works for anything really.
Weighly is version 4 of Troop 30's scale program for food drives. On our last food drive we collected and tracked over 2 tons of food!

To use Weighly, go to [weighly.app](https://weighly.app) and make an account. Once you have an account you can make a new event and start adding weights!

Features to be added:

- Set up python app for use with physical scale
- delete events
- add other admin to events
- custom urls
- more uniform code

Weighly uses supabase for backend and the svelte site is hosted on vercel.
